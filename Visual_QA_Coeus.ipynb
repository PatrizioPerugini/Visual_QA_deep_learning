    "As shown from the evaluation this model achieves a final accuracy of **27%** on the validation set. By looking carefully the results we can see how only answers like \"yes/no\" are given correctly (>65%) while the performances are heavily penalized by \"other\" and \"number\" question types. Scoring so poorly we tried to improve the language model using a Bi-LSTM over the simple LSTM to attain better performances, but we got the same training trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may not look good but it was actually a real breakthrough. The bottleneck of our network as one can expect is the CNN. Using VGG the model is not able to correctly learn specific features in an image (for instance to count objects), but it is able in some cases to answer easy questions which would require a yes/no answer; this subproblem can be seen as a classification task that our model is able to solve.\n",
